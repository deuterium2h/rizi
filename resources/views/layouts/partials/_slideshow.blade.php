								Barangay San Isidro
							</h2>
				
							<p>
								While the name San Isidro represented the Patron Saints of Farmers, unlike before, agriculture is now limited to backyard farming, planting seasonal leafy vegetables and poultry and livestock-raising. The people are mostly laborers, workers, tricycle drivers, self-employed, small entrepreneurs, government and private employees. Garments and ceramics manufacturing, on a small scale, dot the area.

								<small>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</small>
								Barangay San Isidro
							</h2>
							<p>
								At  the  time  of  creation  of  the Municipality  of  Antipolo, there  were  four  Barangays  that  comprised the municipality, namely Barrio Uno, Barrio Dos, Barrio Tres   and  Barrio  Quatro.   When  Republic   Act   3590  (Revised Barrio Charter)  was approved in 1961, Barrio Tres became Barrio San Isidro  named after the Patron Saint of the Farmers,  the main  occupation of most of the residents then.   Republic Act  No.  3975,  enacted on June 22, 1963,  provided  recognition  to  Barangay San  Isidro,  as  a   full-complement   Barangay   of  the Municipality of Antipolo.
